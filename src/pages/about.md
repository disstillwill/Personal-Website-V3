> Live, laugh, debug

My name is William Svoboda, but you can call me Will 😉. I’m a senior at Princeton University in New Jersey studying computer science. I didn’t start programming until I was in college, but that hasn’t stopped my love for technology and all the things you can do with it.

I’m especially interested in the Web and projects that combine technical and visual challenges. Over the years that’s meant exploring game development, web applications, computer graphics, and more. When I’m not in school you might find me listening to new wave music, watching YouTube film analyses, or playing games from 10 years ago.

This website is my space to [write](/posts) and talk about my [work](/projects). I also have a [résumé](../static/documents/resume.pdf) and am actively looking for new opportunities.

## Colophon

This website was started in the summer of 2021, but is actually the third time I’ve made a personal site. My [first](https://thisstillwill.github.io/Personal-Website-V1/) and [second](https://thisstillwill.github.io/Personal-Website-V2/) websites were made the year prior using vanilla HTML and CSS. A full list of the tools I use now are below:

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for content
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) for site generation
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for code hosting
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) for domain names
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment

The code for this site is public and I welcome feedback of any kind. Why don’t you try clicking _“Edit this Page”_ below?
